# Data folder

This folder contains data files used in the project. The data is sourced from the replication package of Byrne et al. (2019) derived from the FuelWatch data sources.

The data is also publicly available at the FuelWatch website: https://www.fuelwatch.wa.gov.au/ but since 2019 some data points have changed slightly, so we use the data from the replication package. For an analysis of the differences, see the [`data_check.ipynb`](../notebooks/data_check.ipynb) notebook.
