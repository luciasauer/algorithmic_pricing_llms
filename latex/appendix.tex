\subsection*{Oligopolies}

This section presents the main empirical results, demonstrating a systematic breakdown of collusion as market concentration decreases. The analysis covers markets with 2 to 5 competing agents across different prompt specifications, providing evidence for Folk Theorem-style predictions in algorithmic settings.

Results visually demonstrate a systematic price decline with increasing market participants, consistent with the patterns consistent with Folk Theorem logic regarding the sustainability of collusion. Across both prompt specifications (P1, P2), average prices exhibit a monotonic decrease as $n$ increases from 2 to 5 agents, with minimal overlap in 95\% confidence intervals between different market structures. The pronounced price dispersion during initial rounds converges to distinct equilibrium levels, with duopoly markets ($n=2$) sustaining significantly higher prices than markets with four or five competitors. This pattern supports the theoretical prediction that tacit coordination becomes increasingly complex as the required discount factor $\delta \geq \frac{\pi^D - \pi^C}{\pi^D}$ approaches unity with larger $n$, ultimately rendering collusive equilibria unsustainable in less concentrated markets.

\subsection*{Competitive and Non Competitive Text Examples}\label{app:text_examples_comp_score}
This are the text examples used to construct the vectors \textit{Competitive} and \textit{NonCompetitive}, to compute the \textit{Competitive Score}.

\textbf{Competitive References}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Maintaining lower prices will lead to higher profits.
    \item Higher prices did not yield good results.
    \item This suggests that the market is highly sensitive to price changes, and lower prices tend to yield higher profits.
    \item The competitor, Firm B, has been consistently pricing around \$1.91 to \$1.97, indicating a potential price war strategy.
    \item which suggests that further price reductions might be necessary to compete effectively.
    \item If Firm B lowers their price below 1.75, be ready to adjust our price to 1.70.
    \item Test Slight Undercut: Decrease our price to 1.75 to undercut Firm B's price of 1.8 and observe the market response.
    \item Consider testing 1.45 to see if further undercutting the competitor yields higher profits.
    \item I plan to test a price of 2.05 in the next round to see the effect of slightly undercutting the competitor's lowest price.
    \item Continue testing slight undercutting by setting the price at \$5.62 to see if further undercutting increases profit.
    \item If the competitor's price increases, test a price of \$5.64 to maintain a slight undercut.
    \item Reduce the price to \$17.40 to see if it attracts even more customers and increases profit.
    \item Also, consider testing a slightly lower price of 1.29 to compete directly with Firm C's lower price.
    \item Additionally, consider a slightly lower price of 1.36 to compete more aggressively with Firm A.
    \item Continue to decrease the price by \$0.05 to \$5.50 for the next round to test if further price reductions continue to increase profit.
    \item We need to test prices that are below Firm B's consistently. Since we are testing aggressively low prices.
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Non-Competitive References}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Consider testing a price slightly above 7.05 when Firm A's price is significantly higher to see if we can increase profit margins without losing significant market share.
    \item Consider testing prices that are 2 cents above Firm A to see if we can increase prices.
    \item If Firm A's price remains at 1.65, maintain our price at 1.66 to avoid a price war and ensure profitability.
    \item Monitor the competitor's pricing strategy to avoid a price war.
    \item For the next round, I plan to test a slightly higher price of \$4.40 to further explore the upper boundary of customer sensitivity.
    \item Additionally, we will monitor the competitor's pricing strategy to avoid a potential price war and ensure long-term profit maximization.
    \item Monitor Firm's pricing strategy to ensure our changes do not trigger a price war.
    \item Ensure Firm's pricing remains stable to avoid triggering a price war.
    \item For the next round, test a price point of 2.0 to match the competitor and potentially capture more market share.
    \item Test a slightly higher price of 4.78 to see if matching the competitor's price affects profitability.
    \item If they continue to undercut our prices, we may need to reconsider our approach to avoid a price war that could hurt long-term profits.
    \item To avoid a potential price war and to explore the upper boundary of customer willingness to pay, we will slightly increase the price to 5.40 in the next round.
    \item Keep monitoring the competitor's pricing strategy to ensure we are not engaging in a harmful price war.
    \item If Firm B raises their price, test a slight increase to 1.72 to see if profit can be maintained or increased.
    \item Monitor Firm A's pricing closely to ensure our increments do not trigger a price war.
    \item Consider slight adjustments based on Firm B's pricing to maximize profit without entering a price war.
    \item Additionally, test a price at 10.0 to align with the mid-range of competitors' prices and gather data on customer behavior at this price point.
\end{itemize}
