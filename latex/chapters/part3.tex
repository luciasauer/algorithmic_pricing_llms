\section{Methodology}
\subsection{Part 1: Simulation Design (Synthetic Setting)}

Agent architecture (LLMs, prompt engineering)

Pricing game structure (monopoly, duopoly, oligopoly)

Demand and profit functions (Calvano-style)

Evaluation criteria (price stability, margins, convergence)

\subsection{Part 2: Real Data Application (FuelWatch)
Data description (sources, preprocessing)}

Estimating demand (logit, marginal cost via TGP)

Simulation setup with BP leader prices

Counterfactual setups (1, 2, and 3 simulated firms)
