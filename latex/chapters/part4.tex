\section{Experiments \& Results}

Synthetic experiments: convergence behavior, comparison to Nash/monopoly

- We replicated Fish et al. successfully with Mistral
- Smaller models have troubles converging to monopoly prices
- We show that multiform oligpol settings also collude



Real market simulations: price following, margin formation, focal point behavior

Tables, graphs, timelines

Interpret results carefully
