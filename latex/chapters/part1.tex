\section{Introduction}

\epigraph{\en{A few years ago, two companies were selling a textbook called The Making of a Fly. One of those sellers used an algorithm which essentially matched its rival’s price. That rival had an algorithm which always set a price 27\% higher than the first. The result was that prices kept spiralling upwards, until finally someone noticed what was going on, and adjusted the price manually. By that time, the book was selling – or rather, not selling – for 23 million dollars a copy.}}{Margrethe Vestager, \emph{European Commissioner}, ~\cite*{vestager_algorithms_2017}}
