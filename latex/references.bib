	abstract = {We formulate a test of the fungibility of money based on parallel shifts in the prices of different quality grades of a commodity. We embed the test in a discrete-choice model of product quality choice and estimate the model using panel microdata on gasoline purchases. We find that when gasoline prices rise, consumers substitute to lower octane gasoline, to an extent that cannot be explained by income effects. Across a wide range of specifications, we consistently reject the null hypothesis that households treat “gas money” as fungible with other income. We compare the empirical fit of three psychological models of decision making. A simple model of category budgeting fits the data well, with models of loss aversion and salience both capturing important features of the time series.},

The primary methodology is to assume that demand can be described by a discrete-choice model and that prices are endogenously determined by price-setting firms. In contrast to some previous empirical work, the techniques explicitly allow for the possibility that prices are correlated with unobserved demand factors in the cross section of markets. The article proposes estimation by "inverting" the market-share equation to find the implied mean levels of utility for each good. This method allows for estimation by traditional instrumental variables techniques.},

Recent advances in Bayesian procedures are explored, including the use of the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm and its variant Gibbs sampling. This second edition adds chapters on endogeneity and expectation-maximization ({EM}) algorithms. No other book incorporates all these fields, which have arisen in the past 25 years.

As a methodological innovation, we calculate such screens for all possible subgroups of three or four bids within a tender and use summary statistics like the mean, median, maximum, and minimum of each screen as predictors in the machine learning algorithm. This approach tackles the issue that competitive bids in incomplete cartels distort the statistical signals produced by bid rigging and it outperforms previously suggested methods in applications to incomplete cartels based on empirical data from Switzerland.},

The model is estimated using panel data on the Quebec City gasoline market and used to evaluate the consequences of a recent vertical merger.

We do so in the markets targeted by the investigation, and in markets throughout the province with similar pre-collapse pricing (cyclical markets).

	abstract = {The advent of artificial intelligence has led to a growing emphasis on data-driven modeling in macroeconomics, with agent-based modeling ({ABM}) emerging as a prominent bottom-up simulation paradigm. In {ABM}, agents (*e.g.*, households, firms) interact within a macroeconomic environment, collectively generating market dynamics. Existing agent modeling typically employs predetermined rules or learning-based neural networks for decision-making. However, customizing each agent presents significant challenges, complicating the modeling of agent heterogeneity. Additionally, the influence of multi-period market dynamics and multifaceted macroeconomic factors are often overlooked in decision-making processes.In this work, we introduce **{EconAgent}**, a large language model-empowered agent with human-like characteristics for macroeconomic simulation. We first construct a simulation environment that incorporates various market dynamics driven by agents' decisions regarding work and consumption. Through the perception module, we create heterogeneous agents with distinct decision-making mechanisms. Furthermore, we model the impact of macroeconomic trends using a memory module, which allows agents to reflect on past individual experiences and market dynamics.Simulation experiments show that {EconAgent} can make realistic decisions, leading to more reasonable macroeconomic phenomena compared to existing rule-based or learning-based agents.

	abstract = {We provide the first empirical analysis of the relationship between algorithmic pricing ({AP}) and competition by studying the impact of adoption in Germany’s retail gasoline market, where software became widely available in 2017. Because adoption dates are unknown, we identify adopting stations by testing for structural breaks in {AP} markers, finding most breaks to be around the time of widespread {AP} introduction. Because station adoption is endogenous, we instrument using headquarter adoption. Adoption increases margins but only for nonmonopoly stations. In duopoly and triopoly markets, margins increase only if all stations adopt, suggesting that {AP} has a significant effect on competition.},

	abstract = {Agent-based modeling and simulation have evolved as a powerful tool for modeling complex systems, offering insights into emergent behaviors and interactions among diverse agents. Recently, integrating large language models into agent-based modeling and simulation presents a promising avenue for enhancing simulation capabilities. This paper surveys the landscape of utilizing large language models in agent-based modeling and simulation, discussing their challenges and promising future directions. In this survey, since this is an interdisciplinary field, we first introduce the background of agent-based modeling and simulation and large language model-empowered agents. We then discuss the motivation for applying large language models to agent-based simulation and systematically analyze the challenges in environment perception, human alignment, action generation, and evaluation. Most importantly, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent works of large language model-empowered agent-based modeling and simulation in multiple scenarios, which can be divided into four domains: cyber, physical, social, and hybrid, covering simulation of both real-world and virtual environments, and how these works address the above challenges. Finally, since this area is new and quickly evolving, we discuss the open problems and promising future directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/{LLM}-Agent-Based-Modeling-and-Simulation.},

	url = {https://papers.ssrn.com/abstract=4606937},
	doi = {10.2139/ssrn.4606937},
	abstract = {The advent of the Web has brought about a paradigm shift in traditional economics, particularly in the digital economy era, enabling the precise recording and analysis of individual economic behavior. This has led to a growing emphasis on data-driven modeling in macroeconomics. In macroeconomic research,  Agent-based modeling ({ABM}) emerged as an alternative, evolving through rule-based agents, machine learning-enhanced decision-making, and, more recently, advanced {AI} agents. However, the existing works are suffering from three main challenges when endowing agents with human-like decision-making, including agent heterogeneity, the influence of macroeconomic trends, and multifaceted economic factors. Large language models ({LLMs}) have recently gained prominence in offering autonomous human-like characteristics. Therefore, leveraging {LLMs} in macroeconomic simulation presents an opportunity to overcome traditional limitations. In this work, we take an early step in introducing a novel approach that leverages {LLMs} in macroeconomic simulation. We design prompt-engineering-driven {LLM} agents to exhibit human-like decision-making and adaptability in the economic environment, with the abilities of perception, reflection, and decision-making to address the abovementioned challenges. Simulation experiments on macroeconomic activities show that {LLM}-empowered agents can make realistic work and consumption decisions and emerge more reasonable macroeconomic phenomena than existing rule-based or {AI} agents. Our work demonstrates the promising potential to simulate macroeconomics based on {LLM} and its human-like characteristics.},

We exploit a unique dataset that contains the universe of station-level prices for an urban market for 15 years, and that encompasses a coordinated equilibrium transition mid-sample. We uncover a gradual, three-year equilibrium transition, whereby dominant firms use price leadership and price experiments to create focal points that coordinate market prices, soften price competition, and enhance retail margins. Our results inform the theory of collusion, with particular relevance to the initiation of collusion and equilibrium selection. We also highlight new insights into merger policy and collusion detection strategies.},

	abstract = {Increasingly, algorithms are supplanting human decision-makers in pricing goods and services. To analyze the possible consequences, we study experimentally the behavior of algorithms powered by Artificial Intelligence (Q-learning) in a workhorse oligopoly model of repeated price competition. We find that the algorithms consistently learn to charge supracompetitive prices, without communicating with one another. The high prices are sustained by collusive strategies with a finite phase of punishment followed by a gradual return to cooperation. This finding is robust to asymmetries in cost or demand, changes in the number of players, and various forms of uncertainty.},
